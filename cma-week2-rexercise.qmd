# ok Task 1: Import your data
```{r}
## Load the necessary libraries ################################################

library(readr) # to import tabular data (e.g. csv)
library(dplyr) # to manipulate (tabular) data
library(ggplot2) # to visualize data
library(sf) # to handle spatial vector data
library(terra) # To handle raster data
library(lubridate) # To handle dates and times

## Import the downloaded csv ##################################################

wildschwein_BE <- read_delim("wildschwein_BE_2056.csv", ",") # adjust path

# to convert it to a spatial object
wildschwein_BE <- st_as_sf(wildschwein_BE, coords = c("E", "N"), crs = 2056, remove = FALSE) # setting remove = FALSE preserves the original (E/N) columns, which come in handy later on
```

# Task 2: Getting an overview 
```{r}
# Calculate the time difference between subsequent rows as described in the demo
wildschwein_BE <- wildschwein_BE |> # Takes wildschwein_BE 
    group_by(TierID) |> # ...group it by TierID
    mutate(timelag_sec = as.integer(difftime(lead(DatetimeUTC), DatetimeUTC, units = "secs")))

# How many individuals were tracked?
ggplot(wildschwein_BE, aes(DatetimeUTC, TierID)) +
  geom_point()
# 3 individuals (002A, 016A, 018A)
# this plot would also be possible using TierName from the dataset
# you can see that for example 002A was tracked the longest of all three individuals 

# or you can use another way to check for individuals in your data 
wildschwein_BE$TierID |> unique() # through TierID
wildschwein_BE$TierName |> unique() # or through TierName 

# For how long were the individuals tracked? Are there gaps?
ggplot(wildschwein_BE, aes(timelag_sec/60)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  lims(x = c(0, 5000/60)) +
  scale_y_log10()
# the individuales were tracked between around 5 to 75 min. Most werde tracked around 15 min with outliers above and under these 15 min. 


# Were all individuals tracked concurrently or sequentially?
ggplot(wildschwein_BE, aes(DatetimeUTC, timelag_sec, col = TierID)) +
  geom_point()
# the individuals were tracked concurrently, as the sampling points in this plot overlap. 

# What is the temporal sampling interval between the locations?
# too much data, filter it
