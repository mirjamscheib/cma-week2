# Task 1: Import your data
```{r}
## Load the necessary libraries ################################################

library(readr) # to import tabular data (e.g. csv)
library(dplyr) # to manipulate (tabular) data
library(ggplot2) # to visualize data
library(sf) # to handle spatial vector data
library(terra) # To handle raster data
library(lubridate) # To handle dates and times

## Import the downloaded csv ##################################################

wildschwein_BE <- read_delim("wildschwein_BE_2056.csv", ",") # adjust path

wildschwein_BE <- st_as_sf(wildschwein_BE, coords = c("E", "N"), crs = 2056, remove = FALSE) # setting remove = FALSE preserves the original (E/N) columns, which come in handy later on
```

# Task 2: Getting an overview 
```{r}
# Calculate the time difference between subsequent rows as described in the demo
wildschwein <- mutate(wildschwein_BE, timelag = as.integer(difftime(lead(DatetimeUTC), DatetimeUTC, units = "secs")))

# How many individuals were tracked?
wildschwein$TierName <- as.factor(wildschwein$TierName)
wildschwein$TierName
# Rosa, Ruth & Sabi = 3 individuals 

# For how long were the individual tracked? Are there gaps?


# Were all individuals tracked concurrently or sequentially?


# What is the temporal sampling interval between the locations?

# Plot 1
ggplot(wildschwein, aes(DatetimeUTC, TierID)) +
  geom_line()

# Plot 2
ggplot(wildschwein, aes(timelag)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Plot 3
ggplot(wildschwein, aes(DatetimeUTC, timelag, col = TierID)) +
  geom_line()
```

# Task 3: Deriving movement parameters I: Speed 
```{r}

```
